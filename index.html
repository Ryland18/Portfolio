        <p style = "margin: 0, 1em;">Hello I am Ryland Martz. I am a Junior at Tecumseh High school, along with <a href="https://sictc.evscschools.com/">SICTIC</a> as a partner school. I have a 4.0 GPA (grade point average) in both School and Computer science. The last job I had was at holiday world and worked as a Rides operator and Drones maintenance crew until the season ended. My job as a Ride operator was to ensure guest have a smooth and positive experieance on the rides that I was assigned to. As a Drone maintenance crew I was in charge of helping with setting up the drones for deployment as well as putting the drones back after the drones land.</p>
        <p style="margin:0, 1em;">My Intrest in computers begain when I was in middle school around when I would become a High schooler. One of the choices of class I could take was Computer science and I thought it would be interesting to learn a little about computers. In the class I learned my first computer language Python, and during this time I became realy interested into computer coding. As a result I took the class Computer science Principles the following year and learned about Blender (a Program that is used to model or sculpt digital images). I took most computer classes for two to three years and stopped for at least one year before joining Sictic as a partner school.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0, 1em;">I hope to become a Game Developer or to take other careers that revolve around Computers. The reason I wish to be a Game Developer is that my main hobbie is playing Video games and after taking computer science I realized that I could create Video games that I can imagine if I became a Game Developer. However I learned that there are other careers that revolve around computers  other than Game development so as such I strive for more than one goal.</p>
